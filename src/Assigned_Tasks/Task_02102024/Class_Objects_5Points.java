// Write 5 points related to the Class and Objects.
/*
Class:
1. Class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects
2. Class contains
a) Data members | Attributes | instance variables | fields | member variables
b) Member functions | Behaviour | Methods
3. It represents the properties and actions of an object.
4. Classes can use access modifiers (public, private, protected, and package-private)
to control the visibility and accessibility of their fields and methods
5. A class can have constructors, which are special methods used to initialize objects.

Object:
1. Instance of a Class
An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the new keyword,
and represents a specific entity with its own unique state based on the fields and
behaviors defined in the class.
2. State and Behavior
Objects have two primary characteristics: state and behavior.
The state of an object is defined by its fields (variables),
while its behavior is defined by the methods (functions) in the class.
3. Memory Allocation
When an object is created, memory is allocated to store its state (field values).
Each object has its own separate copy of the fields,
but all instances of a class share the same method definitions.
4. Reference Variable
In Java, objects are accessed through reference variables.
A reference variable holds the memory address of the object.
For example, Car myCar = new Car(); creates an object of type Car and myCar refers to it.
5. Object Lifecycle
An object in Java is created using the new keyword and lives in the heap memory.
Once it is no longer referenced by any part of the program,
it becomes eligible for garbage collection, which automatically reclaims memory
used by objects no longer in use.
