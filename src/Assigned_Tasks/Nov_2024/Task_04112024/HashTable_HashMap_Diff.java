/*
### 1. **Synchronization**
- **Hashtable**: Synchronized, meaning it is thread-safe.
- **HashMap**: Not synchronized, so it is not thread-safe by default.
### 2. **Null Keys and Values**
- **Hashtable**: Does **not allow null** keys or values. Attempting to insert a `null`  key or value will throw a `NullPointerException` .
- **HashMap**: Allows one `null`  key and multiple `null`  values, making it more flexible in cases where null values are needed.
### 3. **Legacy vs. Modern**
- **Hashtable**: A legacy class from the early versions of Java (part of Java 1.0). It has been retrofitted to implement the `Map`  interface, but many of its methods are now considered outdated.
- **HashMap**: Introduced in Java 1.2 as part of the Collections Framework. It is a modern, more flexible, and generally preferred implementation of the `Map`  interface.
### 4. **Performance**
- **Hashtable**: Generally slower due to synchronized methods, which add a performance overhead.
- **HashMap**: Faster in non-threaded environments since it is unsynchronized. Itâ€™s the preferred choice for single-threaded applications.
### 5. **Subclassing**
- **Hashtable**: Extends the `Dictionary`  class, which is also a legacy class. This makes it part of the older Java API design.
- **HashMap**: Extends `AbstractMap` , part of the modern Java Collections Framework, which brings additional flexibility.
### 6. **Iterators**
- **Hashtable**: Uses an enumerator for iterating elements, which is not as flexible as the `Iterator`  used by modern collections.
- **HashMap**: Uses an `Iterator` , which allows the use of enhanced `for-each`  loops and supports the `fail-fast`  mechanism (if the map is structurally modified after creating the iterator, it will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` ).
